# Project Intelligence for Deep Research

This file captures key patterns, preferences, and project intelligence specific to Deep Research to enhance future interactions and development.

## General Guidelines:
- Prioritize concise and concrete information over verbose explanations.
- Maintain functionality while optimizing for token efficiency.

## Memory Bank Management:
- `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and goals. No sensitive data.
- `productContext.md`: User experience and core functionality.
- `systemPatterns.md`: High-level architecture, simplified diagrams.
- `techContext.md`: Technologies, libraries, APIs, constraints.
- `activeContext.md`: Current work focus, recent decisions, immediate next steps.
- `progress.md`: What works, what's left to build, known issues.

## Code Style & Practices:
- Minimize redundant comments.
- Reduce excessive console logging, especially for routine operations.
- Remove unused code (variables, functions, imports).
- Ensure all functionality is preserved during optimization.

## Specific Project Patterns:
- **Authentication:** Session-based using `SESSION_SECRET_TOKEN` from `.env`.
- **Data Persistence:** Research results saved as JSON files in `data/results/`.
- **LLM Interaction:** OpenRouter API, streaming via SSE. Retry mechanism in `server.js`.
- **Frontend:** Plain HTML/CSS/JS, IndexedDB for history.
- **Configuration:** `.env` for sensitive keys and configurable parameters.
